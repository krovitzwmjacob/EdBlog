            <h3>August 2, 2023</h3>
            <p>This blog post features and original lesson plan that concerns the topic of symbolism (an object, shape, sign, or character used to represent something else) and combining it with mental health. This lesson takes the idea of an object having significant meaning and representing something else and connecting it to student's own lives. Students, with their understanding of symbolism, will create a symbol of their own and descibe its meaning.</p>

            <h3>July 16, 2023</h3>
            <p>In this blog post, I discuss ways teachers instill mental health strategies and strengthen our students' mental wellbeing just by being teachers. Using research from Raymond Wallar's book, <i>Fostering Child and Adolescent Mental Health in the Classroom</i>, and my own observations and anecdotal evidence, I share ways that teachers can (and most likely already do) to promote positive mental health practices within our students.</p>
